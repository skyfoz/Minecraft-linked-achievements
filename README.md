# Minecraft-linked-achievements

This code allows every player to have the same achievements, I did this to do a 100% with friends. Achievements with multiples steps are also counted, for the "Adventuring Time" for example, a player could have visited half of the biomes and another player the other half, the achievement would be unlocked.

To make this work you gotta run the code when your server is closed, both main.py and serverside.json gotta be in the same folder, and you gotta replace the path to the players achievements ( made this for fun it isn't optimized or anything )
